# Tool for analyzing Lego project data #

We keep these separate from the actual program as this might be
redistributed and we don't want any clutter.

## Running

As everything is running in F# interactive mode and is just a script,
you need not to compile. Simply run

```
$ ./analyze <path/fo/file>+
```
